## C# Snake
A simple snake game developed in C#.

The game was developed in order to test my knowledge and learn new things whilst doing so.

The game developed allows for the user to control the snake on game, increase it's size by eating the "apples" and reset if they end up *byting*  their own tale. 

> The game may contain bugs, due to the on going self-development process to learn.
